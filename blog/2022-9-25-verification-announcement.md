# Server Manager has been verified! 🎉

Server Manager has offically been **verified** by Discord! I'd like to thank the whole Development Team for making this possible. Without their help of feature ideas, growth help, and support, the bot wouldn't have growed as fast as it did within a few weeks. It has been counted and in just a week, the bot grew with **23 new servers** (that kept the bot). 23 servers new servers is amazing growth in just a span of 7 days. We have much more in store for Server Manager and many new features on the way. We take **your** suggestions in the [support server](https://discord.gg/6bCKvP24kb) and allow them to be voted on by fellow members to see what everyone wants to see and not see in the bot. We are always looking for feedback on how to improve Server Manager. It doesn't hurt to join our support server and contribute to the bot that you may use in your own server!

:::tip

Our roadmap is constantly being updated with new feature that we're added. [Check it out](/roadmap)!
