Want to unlock the full potential of **Server Manager**? Support us on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com).


## Supporter Tier
Support the bot with a $2 donation. This will help with hosting costs. To show our thanks, we're giving you Server Manager Premium as long as you keep paying monthly. Another perk to this is that you get a Premium Supporter role in the support server (only available if you're in the [support server](/support.html)).

### Perks
  - **Access to premium commands**
  - Access to **beta** features
  - The `Premium Supporter` role in the [support server](/support.html)
  - Exclusive sneak peaks

## Super Supporter Tier
**Get your very own custom branded Server Manager**! The custom client/bot will <u>not be modified code-wise what so ever</u>, however, it comes with free premium and a custom name/custom profile picture. All of this you can set on the Developer Portal on your Discord account. Please note that you will have to give the Developer the token from the Developer Portal in order for the bot to appear online. A status command is included in the custom bot so you can customize the bot's status to fit your server.

:::info

The **Advanced Supporter** tier is the same as this tier, but offers downgraded hosting compared to the Super Supporter Tier (the hosting that Server Manager uses).

:::

### Perks
  - Everything in the previous tier
  - **Custom branded Server Manager**


:::note
Please note that you must be in the [support server](/support.html) to be able to redeem this tier along with the other tiers! While you have this tier, your payment pays for the hosting for your bot. You also **do not** get access to your custom branded bot's code.

You will be able to customize the bot's profile picture and name to your liking as you will have access to the bot's application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.dev). You will have to give us this token to use or else the bot won't be online.

If you mess with the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.dev) application and it cause your bot to go offline, you will have to contact our support bot.
