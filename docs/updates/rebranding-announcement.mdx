On July 19th, 2022, we (Ticket System Development) applied for Ticket System (our previous bot) to get verified. However, that didn't work out on a count of a false decision by Discord to deny our bot for verification.

So we are making a new bot under a different name, 'brand', and purpose. Our new bot is called **Server Manager**. We are taking this opportunity to grow as a Development Team and as Bot Developers. We are rebranding to a multipurpose bot because we believe simple moderation is something every server needs, but doesn't always get it. We appreciate everyone who is supporting and will continue to support our project and goal. Again, we have more features in store for Server Manager!

We ask that you remove the old Ticket System from your server(s) as it's deprecated and not going to be online anymore and soon will be deleted. After doing this we request you to add **Server Manager** to your server if you'd like to keep supporting our project and goal to help servers with the complicated stuff. However, this is up to you. We have a lot in store for you all that keep supporting us.
